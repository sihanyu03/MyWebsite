I'm interested in building systems that replace fragile, manual processes with
scalable and efficient alternatives. We live in a world where innovation often
happens faster than adaptation to it, resulting in cases where inefficiency is
accepted as 'just how things are', when tools for better alternatives are fully
achievable.

This requires working close to the system and gaining exposure to how things are done
in practice, while keeping an eye out for opportunities for improvement. I enjoy
understanding about different industries, and treating their problems as engineering
challenges.

I'm currently studying Information & Computer Engineering at the University of Cambridge,
where I've worked on a wide range of projects spanning GPU high-performance computing,
optimisation, computational statistics, and applied machine learning. Alongside my
studies, I have taken on several leadership roles across multiple student
organisations, including serving as President in Cambridge International Students'
Association, and gained practical work experience in both engineering and the financial
industry.

I am excited about opportunities to dive deeper into what are the key bottlenecks
in different industries and push for meaningful improvements by applying technical
insight.
